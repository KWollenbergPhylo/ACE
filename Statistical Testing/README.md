# Statistical Testing
A Statistical test provides a mechanism for making quantitative decisions about a process or processes. Its intent is to determine whether there is enough evidence to reject a null hypothesis or hypothesis about the process. Â The course will cover designing the statistical testing process, understanding and interpreting the basic statistical concepts (p-value, confidence interval, etc.), and the most common statistical testing methods in clinical research. The course will also include a hands-on component using GraphPad Prism and R statistical language to perform common statistical tests. 

#### The detailed topics will be covered in this course: 
- Introduction to statistical testing process 
- Common statistical tests, including two-sample t-test, one-way ANOVA, two-way ANOVA, multiple testing, etc. 
- Application in GraphPad Prism and R
