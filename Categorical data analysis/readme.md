# Introduction to Categorical Data Analysis

Welcome to the Training Session provided by Bioinformatics and Computational Biosciences Branch (BCBB).

Categorical data analysis plays an important role in statistical analysis. It represents the type of data in categories. One of the common way to organize categorical data is by contingency table (cross tabulation table). This course will introduce methods of doing categorical data analysis. It is designed for three hours, and consists of lecture(2hrs), hands-on practice(0.5 hr) and Q&A(0.5 hr). Rstudio will be used in the hands-on component.


### Intro
Basic concepts such as discrete random variable, distribution for categorical data, useful statistic in clinical trial, analyzing contingency table, statistical testing of independence and introduction to generalized linear model about categorical data will be introduced.
