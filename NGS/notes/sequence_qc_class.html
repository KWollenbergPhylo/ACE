# Sequencing intro

##  DNA polymerisation
![](assets/img/image10.png)

+ In nature, during DNA replication, the purpose of DNA polymerisation is to the next complementary base to the new strand.
+ The purpose of sequencing is to **figuring out what that next base added is**
+ **This is where the various sequencing technologies differ**

---

## Basic steps: Sample to data
+ Protocol depends on sample type and sequencing type.

1. Extract the DNA.  
2. Library preparation.
    + Fragmenting the DNA.
    + Adding *adapter* sequences to the ends.
3. Template amplication*
    + Clonal amplification of the fragments to ensure a clear signal.
4. Sequencing*

\*3 &amp; 4 take place in the sequencing machine.

#  Files

---
## File Formats

+ Sequence Data
	+ FASTA/QUAL
	+ FASTQ
	+ FAST5 - nanopore
	+ Older formats – sff
+ Alignment Data
	+ SAM
	+ BAM
	+ BED


---

##  FASTA and/or QUAL 

+ Sequence and quality scores are separate files – old data
+ Or FASTA only with no quality data available
	+ Pre-processed in some way
+ Header
+ Sequence
	+ All on one line
	+ Or it will be truncated – 80-120 characters

## FASTQ

- Sequence and quality in single file


`@M03213:59:000000000-AWR6D:1:1101:12406:1145 1:N:0:NCCTGAGC+NTATTAAG`
`GTGCCAGCAGCCGCGGTAATACGGAGGGTGCGAGCGTTAATCGGAATAACTGGGCGTAAAGGGCACGCAGGCGGATTTTTAAGTGAGGTNTGAAAGCCCCGGGCTTAACCTGGGAATTGCATTTCAGACTGGGAATCTAGAGTACTTTAGGGAGGGGTAGAATTCCACGTGTAGCGGTGAAATGCGTAGAGATGTGGAGGAATACCGAAGGCGAAGGCAGCCCCTTGGGAATGTACTGNCGCTCATGGTCGAACGCGTGGG`

### Header

`@&lt;instrument&gt;:&lt;run number&gt;:&lt;flowcell&gt;:&lt;lane&gt;:&lt;tile&gt;:&lt;x-pos&gt;:&lt;y-pos&gt;  &lt;read&gt;:&lt;is filtered&gt;:&lt;control number&gt;:&lt;sample number&gt;`

- Read identifier is the beginning part (before the space)
- The end part (after the space) is used for demuxing or PE information

### Raw sequence
- All on one line - no spaces - DNA or RNA, should be one of the IUPAC characters.

##  FASTQ Quality Scores
+ called **Phred** scores after the inventor **Ph**il Green.


### How are they calculated?
1. Phred score Q:  Given *p*, the probability that the corresponding base call is incorrect,  
*Q = -log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;p*. 
    + 40 is usually highest score – very, very rarely up to 60
2. Add constant: Q+C
    + usually, *C = 33* &amp;rarr; Phred+33 format is most common (Illumina &gt; 1.8 ~2011)
3. This value, Q+C, is encoded as an [ASCII](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pattis/15-1XX/common/handouts/ascii.html) character in the FASTQ file.

## Example    

```
@M03213:59:000000000-AWR6D:1:1101:12406:1145 1:N:0:NCCTGAGC+NTATTAAG
GTGCCAGCAGCCGCGGTAATACGGAGGGTGCGAGCGTTAATCGGAATAACTGGGCGTAAAGGGCACGCAGGCGG
+
-6,ACGGAEFGGG&lt;&lt;FFG?FC@EF8AFCFGEGGCCCBGGGGGGDGGGGGEEFA&lt;FGCE,EFDCFFFGGGGCCDG
```

*Example*  
First quality character is `-` which is *45* in the ASCII table.  
*Q = 45-33 = 12*

.pull-right[![](assets/img/image16.png)]

Line 3 is single '+' https:// www.cs.cmu.edu /~ pattis /15-1XX/common/handouts/ ascii.html 

Phred+33 is Sanger standard. Illumina switched around different standards for a while and settled back to Phred+33.
Starting with Illumina 1.3-1.7 used Phred+64.
Illumina 1.5-1.7 if quality scores were below Q15 at end of read, were arbitrarily assigned score 2 which is B.

##  Single End vs Paired End 

![](assets/img/image19.jpg)


---

##  Adapters, Primers, Indexes 

+ Reads from a sequencer may have extra sequences on either end that we should remember are there
+ Indexes are used by the sequencer to separate data into separate sample files – **demultiplex**

##  Anatomy of an Illumina Run 

+ What comes out of the sequencer?

##  Converting and Demultiplexing 

+ Illumina sequencer can convert &amp; demux itself
+ [bcl2fastq](https://support.illumina.com/sequencing/sequencing_software/bcl2fastq-conversion-software.html)
	+ Converts BaseCalls to FASTQ
	+ Demultiplexes the data
		+ Reads that it can't figure out goes into files called "Undetermined"
		+ Should check if the Undetermined files are unreasonably Large
		+ Uses SampleSheet.csv to map barcodes to samples
+ Other tools
	+ Idemp - https://github.com/yhwu/idemp, fastq-pair https://github.com/linsalrob/fastq-pair



---

##  How to assess data quality? 

+ The sequencing lab runs quality-control tests to ensure that the actual run was successful.
+ We should run our own QC prior to analysis
	+ We should all be skeptics! To avoid misinterpretation of the data due to unexpected bias
+ QC measurements can report the following:
	+ Percent GC in sample reads
	+ Presence of overrepresented kmers and sequences such as adapters
	+ Per base quality score
	+ Distribution of nucleotide bases
+ After mapping reads to a genome, additional test could be run to determine:
	+ Mapping error rate
	+ Percent of possible PCR duplicates (reads with same start and end position in reference genome)
	+ Distribution of insert size (pair ends)

Pyrosequencing - infer the nucleotides from light production of enzyme luciferase.

First HTS machine was the GS 20

Technically, Sanger and pyrosequencing are also methods of sequencing by synthesis (using dna polymer
ase to add nucleotides to the complementary strand of the template, but that's what solexa called the
ir method

Amplification methods differ

454

DNA molecules being clonally amplified in an emulsion PCR (emPCR). Adapter ligation and PCR produces
DNA libraries with appropriate 5′ and 3′ ends, which can then be made single stranded and immobilized
 onto individual suitably oligonucleotide-tagged microbeads. Bead-DNA conjugates can then be emulsifi
ed using aqueous amplification reagents in oil, ideally producing emulsion droplets containing only o
ne bead (illustrated in the two leftmost droplets, with different molecules indicated in different co
lours). Clonal amplification then occurs during the emPCR as each template DNA is physically separate
 from all others, with daughter molecules remaining bound to the microbeads. This is the conceptual b
asis underlying sequencing in 454, Ion Torrent and polony sequencing protocols.

Illumina – bridge amplification

##  Short History of Sequencing 3 

+ Third generation - long read
+ Sometimes characterized by not needing amplification – potentially sequencing entire single molecules (SMS)
+ PacBio – SMRT
	+ Fast
	+ ~10kb
	+ Error rate only a little higher than short read
+ Oxford Nanopore – ION
	+ Faster and cheaper
	+ Error rates are higher than for short reads
	+ 5-10kb
+ 10X Genomics
	+ New methods of barcodes/indexing
